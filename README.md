# RestoreMonitor

I had an issue with windows whenever my machine goes to sleep, windows keep moving around when the machine wakes up!

This has been going on for years and there was no tool that can help, what I need was a simple tool that can save the current open windows and just restore them to their place.


Enter RestoreMonitor

Simple tool to save the current location of windows and with a click of a button restore them.

Future features:

* Auto save the current location of windows
* Smart detect when monitors as detected to be un-plugged and re-plugged by Windows
* Restore the current location of windows automatically
* Save z order of windows
